            Henceforward:

            All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Buyers and Sellers alone. The
            commercial/contractual terms include without limitation price, shipping costs, payment methods, payment
            terms, date, period and mode of delivery, warranties related to products and services and after sales

            features immediately upon Delivery or non Delivery within the time period as provided in Policies. Non
            notification by You of Delivery or non Delivery within the time period specified in the Policies shall be
            construed as a deemed Delivery in respect of that Transaction. In case of Cash On Delivery transactions,
            Buyer is not required to confirm the receipt of products or services.
            You, as a Buyer, shall be entitled to claim a refund of the Transaction Price (as Your sole and exclusive
            remedy) in case You do not receive the Delivery within the time period agreed in the Transaction or within
            the time period as provided in the Policies, whichever is earlier. In case you do not raise a refund claim
            using Platform features within the stipulated time than this would make You ineligible for a refund.

            collection and remittance of payment or by an individual Buyer during any time period, and reserves the
            right to refuse to process Transactions exceeding such limit.
            Flipkart reserves the right to refuse to process Transactions by Buyers with a prior history of questionable
            charges including without limitation breach of any agreements by Buyer with Flipkart or breach/violation of
            any law or any charges imposed by Issuing Bank or breach of any policy.
            Flipkart may do such checks as it deems fit before approving the receipt of/Buyers commitment to pay (for
            Cash On Delivery transactions) Transaction Price from the Buyer for security or other reasons at the
            discretion of Flipkart. As a result of such check if Flipkart is not satisfied with the creditability of the
            Buyer or genuineness of the Transaction or other reasons at its sole discretion, Flipkart shall have the
            right to reject the receipt of / Buyers commitment to pay Transaction Price. For avoidance of doubt, it is

            Flipkart may delay notifying the payment confirmation i.e. informing Seller to Dispatch, if Flipkart deems
            suspicious or for Buyers conducting high transaction volumes to ensure safety of the Transaction and
            Transaction Price. In addition, Flipkart may hold Transaction Price and Flipkart may not inform Seller to
            Dispatch or remit Transaction Price to law enforcement officials (instead of refunding the same to Buyer) at
            the request of law enforcement officials or in the event the Buyer is engaged in any form of illegal
            activity.
            The Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Flipkart will not be liable for any damages, interests or claims etc.
            resulting from not processing a Transaction/Transaction Price or any delay in processing a
            Transaction/Transaction Price which is beyond control of Flipkart.
